## PROJECT MATH-SKILLS

### Objectives
This program should be able to read from a file and print the result of each statistic mentioned below.
The statistics to be computed are :
1.  Average
2.  Median
3.  Variance
4.  Standard Deviation

The above mentioned are seperated from the main file and stored in their own functions in [skills](./skills/skills.go) file.

In other words, this program must be able to read the data present in the path passed as argument.

### Testing
In the [skills_test](./skills/skills_test.go) is where this program has tested each statistics computation.
